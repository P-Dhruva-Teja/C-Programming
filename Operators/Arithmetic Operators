-> The binary arithmetic operators are +,-,*,/ and the modulus operator %.
-> Integer division truncates any fractional part.
-> The % operator cannot be applied to float or double.
-> The binary + and - operators have the same precedence, which is lower than the precedence of *,/, and %, which is in turn lower than unary + and - arithmetic operators associative left to right.
